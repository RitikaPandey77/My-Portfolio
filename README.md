# My-Portfolio

As a Software Engineer, it is necessary to have a good portfolio. What can be a better way to do it rather than using all of your coding skills here. And my last two remaining brain cells love technical writing so, using it as well too. 
While I keep busy fixing the codes, suddenly at 2 AM some thoughts struck my head and I put them on my Instagram. Thus, I am guilty of being creative too.


I have used the following languages for creating the portfolio,
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

Now, for global deployment, I have used 
1. Heroku Platform
2. Flask (for providing base platform to the website)
3. Python (for deploying on heroku)

THANKS!
